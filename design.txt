SLUGS-Logger Design Document
============================

Basic Primary Requirements
------------------

Speed
    Fast enough to keep up with 115200 UART
    
Buffer
    Enough buffer space to deal with card nonresponses and potential disconnections
    Conduct tesing to specify minimum buffer
    
Card Preservation
    Does not write to single sectors frequently
    
    
Basic Secondary Requirements
----------------------------

Speed
    CAN speeds (250 kbaud)
    
Hardware Acceleration
    Data checksum
